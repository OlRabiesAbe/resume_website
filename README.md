TODO:
	
	Add text for imprimis and UWT project entries
	
	Create games/books/cooking sections
		
		Favorite books: House of Leaves, Master & Margarita, If on a Winter's Night a Traveler, American Gods, Song of Achilles, Autobiography of Red, Salt Fat Acid Heat, 
			
			Maybe I should do favorite authors instead?
		
		Cool games section: Favorite games would be too hard to decide
			
			Maybve it shows like four most recent additions, and a link takes you to a seperate page
			
			Just pic of the game and a link to the steam page: i dont want to write anything
		
		Pics of food i cooked
			
			Maybe recipes? Maybe too much work
