						ðŸ™¤ In the early summer of 2019, I and four other CSCII students at UWT were approached with an internship opportunity by the university's community service department.<br>
						Students could log community service hours with approved organizations in exchange for credits and a medal of recognition. Up until then, students had done this through a poorly-implemented Google Form; we were asked to build a dedicated website.
						Over the next five months, we operated together as a team to build a web app from scratch in a self imposed quasi-Scrum environment. It was an incredible learning experience.
						We completed the product and met all of our core requirements. When we presented it to him, the department head was deeply pleased with what we delivered.
					</p>
					<p class="text-block">
						It was all for naught however: within a week of our finishing the portal, the university reduced the funding of the community service department by more than half. The head was forced to quit on account of his pay cut and his replacement was uninterested in our work.
						The code still sits on the UWT servers to this day, unused and partially gutted. I could not secure a copy of my work, so all I have to show for that summer are these screenshots.

					<p class="text-block"> <!-- Panel main text body -->
						ðŸ™¤ This was a Javascript browser game I made for a group project in my third year of college. In Digital Worlds, I and two other students designed and programmed a game over a semester. 
						We were afforded total freedom as to what we made, only that we had to deliver a finished project by the end of the quarter. After some discussion of things like scope and our relative abilities, 
						we settled on making a pretty basic 2D platformer about a cat running around a city. We understood that an all-too-common pitfall in software development was overestimating what can be accomplished with
						the available time and resources, so we decided to keep our goals conservative and divided the workload among us according to ability. 
						This proved a tactful move, as we were able to deliver a mostly finished project by the deadline where other teams failed. 
					</p>
					
					<p class="pretty-text text-block">
						While a bit rough-around-the-edges, UCG is a solid team project that I can honestly say I'm proud of.

						Imprimis

					</h2>
					
					<p class="text-block"> <!-- Panel main text body -->
						ðŸ™¤ As a fork of the Tesseract engine, Imprimis is an open source project to escape from the common pitfalls of the Cube family of engines while preserving their better aspects. 
						Tesseract is ripe with potential as a FOSS game engine with octree based level geometry. That said the codebase is riddled with bugs and bad coding practices.
						The goal of Imprimis is to reduce these issues, producing an intuitive and effective engine and a multiplayer FPS built on it. 
					</p>
					
					<p class="pretty-text text-block">
						My involvment in the Imprimis project has been ongoing and I'll always be eager to help out with its development.
